# Toward Robust and Efficient Online Adaptation for Deep Stereo Depth Estimation (ICRA 2021)

This is the code for my ICRA 2021 [paper](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/papers/knowles-icra21.pdf), written during my M.Eng in the Robust Robotics Group.

> Note: I'm in the process of migrating and cleaning up the code here, and it's not in a working state at the moment.

## Codebase

- Pretrained models are located in `resources/pretrained_models`
- More information on dataset splits is in `splits/README.md`
- The `experiments` folder contains scripts for running training/adaptation
- Scripts used to generate figures are in `evaluation`

## Setup

You can install the dependencies by running `pipenv install`.
