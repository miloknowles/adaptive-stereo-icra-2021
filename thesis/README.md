# Toward Robust Stereo Depth Estimation: Uncertainty Learning, Novelty Detection, and Online Adaptation

This repository contains the code necessary to re-train models and replicate results from Milo Knowles' M-Eng Thesis.

**Disclaimer #1**: Some of this code is outdated, and a better implementation probably exists in the surrounding repository! I kept all of this code around for compatibility with my thesis work.

**Disclaimer #2**: A lot of paths (e.g. to training log folders) are hardcoded for my machine, sorry!

# TODOs
- Refactor old evaluation code so that it works again
- Refactor old adaptation code so that it works again
